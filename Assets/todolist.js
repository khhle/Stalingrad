Brian!!!!! why do you put Soviet army on the right side =.= 
According to google, German army was on the right side, the upper part of the river, and Soviet was attacking from the lower part. 

Anyways, there is a river in Stalingrad, but I don't know how we gonna implement it. 
Some units can't move over river, but they can shoot across it. Then air units can fly over river. So....? 


Bug notice:
rusian bomer uses german bomber prefab ??
array out of bound happends sometimes
flipping camera will not flip building unit. Try to implement, but slowing down the game and laggy...
